# Quick Start Guide

## For Beginners (First Time)

### Windows:
1. Double-click `setup.bat` (installs Python dependencies)
2. Double-click `run.bat` (starts the app)

### Mac/Linux:
1. Open terminal in this folder
2. Run: `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`
3. Run: `chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh`

## For Developers

Just run: `python main.py`

## What you get:
- A compact study timer with large, easy buttons
- Session tracking (25min work + 5min break cycles)
- Task management (add/edit/delete/complete tasks)
- Sound effects (optional)
- All data saved automatically

## Troubleshooting:
- If sound doesn't work: Install pygame (`pip install pygame`)
- If app doesn't start: Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
- For issues: Check `data/tasks_data.json` exists (created automatically)
